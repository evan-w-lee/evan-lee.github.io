### A brief history:

Rapid was one of my first projects. It's been through many revisions, but I traced its origins back to a random project on CodePen (which I copied and branded as my own.)

*Sorry, JuicyWatermelon.*

I did make most of it, though. My friend (KingOfSpadesXX, I know it's a dumb name) made a little copy. I don't think it works, but here you go: (Don't expect too much, it has some goofy-aaa style)

**A random person's search engine:**

I checked: yeah, it's broken.
