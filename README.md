<h1 id="chocolate">Chocolate Factory</h1>
A relaxing clicker game about making chocolate

**Latest website release:** 
<a href="https://evan-w-lee.github.io/chocolate-factory/chocolate">evan-w-lee.github.com/chocolate-factory/chocolate</a>

## Versions

### ALPHA v0.6.0
**NOTES:**
Worker pay was really, really messed up. I'm sorry, it was a nightmare to debug. You know what I had to do to make the workers pay increase correctly? Instead of doing the simple thing (worker pay + 0.1), I had to this: (worker pay - -0.1). Yep, subtracting by a negative number.

Also, I was dumb and updated my computer with the update log not saved, so I was in the middle of making this update and I had no idea what I changed cause I lost all the info. I had to compare v0.5.6 to the code saved on my hard drive. If only I was smarter. :/

**FEATURES:**
* Changed Kacao Kulture back to Cacao Culture because it looked weird
* Added the Donuts project
* Made the workers slower
* Reworked the worker pay system (the workers are done, I promise)

**BUGS:**
* Fixed bug where workers still work when their pay is $0.00
* Fixed floating-point rounding errors in the worker pay (0.5 == 0.498758937)

<h1 id="shape">Shape Clicker</h1>

I actually might update it more in the future. You can definitely tell it was made by a child, but it's simple and at least kind of fun. I still have some interesting ideas. It has potential.

<h1 id="rapid">Rapid</h1>
A simple search engine for the web using jQuery.

**It's actually kinda cool:**

### A brief history:

Rapid was one of my first projects. It's been through many revisions, but I traced its origins back to a random project on CodePen (which I copied and branded as my own.)

*Sorry, JuicyWatermelon.*

I did make most of it, though. My friend (KingOfSpadesXX, I know it's a dumb name) made a little copy. I don't think it works, but here you go: (Don't expect too much, it has some goofy-ahh style)

**A random person's search engine:**
<a href="https://zoomplex.superhi.hosting">zoomplex.superhi.hosting</a>

I checked: yeah, it's broken.

<h1 id="directory">Directory</h1>
Hosts most of my old projects. It's fun to explore, if SuperHi isn't down again :(((

**Here you go:**
<a href="https://directory.superhi.hosting">directory.superhi.hosting</a>

Fun fact: this is made from a W3Schools tempate. I probably use W3Schools too much (I even used it for my newest project) but it's how I learned and that's all that matters, right?
